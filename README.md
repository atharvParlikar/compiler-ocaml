# Compiler

This is my attempt at writing a compiler (or an interpreter not sure yet), using OCaml.

This achieves 3 things,

1. Learning OCaml because I want to understand functional bros
2. Learn about compilers, because I will learn about assembly and low level optimizations.
3. It makes me look cool.
